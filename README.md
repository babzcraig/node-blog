# node-blog
The 4th of 10 projects I am working on in NodeJS starting from a simple server to an eLearning program

Part of a drive to master NodeJS concepts with real world examples. The node blog is a micro blog app that allows a user write  ablog post that get's displayed on the site. User authentication is not a part of the scope of this project.
The main objectives are working with monk in place of mongoose, handling routing and requests and working with Jade for templating.
